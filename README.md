# CSWhy
A simple yet (was) working CS2 External cheat

# This doesn't work
CSWhy was developed as a side project, was never made to work like a proper cheat, yet it still worked until ~ September 13. After then, it stopped working. 
I tried fixing it, but due to a lack of skill, I've failed. 
I think it's best to put this project to archive, and move on to developing something better.

Thanks everyone who used CSWhy!

# Offsets & dumping
Update the offsets, by dumping them from the latest cs2 build with an [a2x's dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper), and copy the .CS files from output to "offsets" folder

# Usage
1. Dump the offsets
2. Update them in code
3. "Publish" the project to a local folder
4. Enjoy
